## How to use ipfs 

We can use ipfs (InterPlanteray File System) in local to add images and folder which is a distributed, peer-to-peer, content-addressed file network where files are stored by content, not by location. 

1. ipfs calculates a hash of the file : the CID
2. the cid is the address of the file 
3. anyone in the world can retrieve the file, but only if at least one node is hosting it. 

Thanks to Pinata, i've created a folder with all my images[https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeibdekyeypcwq7ko6vxoyp6hdt3ex66rmmkilrbkvd54mrfx5jfkeu/], and all my metadata[https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeiared3jjn6bu3es4x7m2gk5nfttrtaw4swywy2eiupo2ewwonwije/]. Every json metadata is an NFT.
